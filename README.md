#### adding github wix code search to your Chorme!
1. in chrome, right click the url bar
2. choose "Edit Search Engines".
3. In "Other Search Engines", go to the end and you'll see 3 empty boxes:
  * the first: it's just a name for you to identify the search engine. e.g., github code search
  * the second: a keyword that will be used to access this search engine. e.g., github. 
  * the third: use this ```https://github.com/search?type=Code&q=%s user:wix``` - the github search page with the code section and the wix user.
4. click "Done".
5. now go to your url bar and write ```github Laboratory``` (copy-paste kicks in the magic if you press TAB after pasting).
6. Enjoy!
